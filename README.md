# Quantum_Computing_1DSchrodinger

This notebook is an implementation with the Qiskit program of the solution of the 1D Free Schrodinger Equation for free electrons with n (arbitrary qubits).
The wavefunction can be initialized as 'gaussian', 'delta', Pi ('step') or 'uniform'.
The simulation of the code is done both on a Fake Backend (Athens) and ont the usual QUASM simulator, and the two are compared. 

The results of the first 5 runs with QUASM are plotted and given in this repository. 

Next steps regarding this "project" will be: 

- Implement a potential V(x)
- Mitigate and correct the results from the Fake Backend
- Run the code for a 4 qubit system on a real Quantum Device

Hope you find interesting! 

See you! :)
